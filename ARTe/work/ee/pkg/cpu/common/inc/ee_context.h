 * The monostack part is complete (obviously, the functions to disable/enable
 *  interrupts are not included here).  For the multistack part you have to
 *  provide two additional things:
 *  1. An assembly implementation of EE_std_change_context_multi(); see below.
 *  2. A #define directive for EE_hal_active_tos, which is just an alias for the
 *  actual architecture-dependent variable.  This variable contains the index of
 *  the current stack.

 * or switch to in this variable.  If the is stacked, its id is marked so. */

/* The multistack version must be implemented in ASM; no standard
 * implementation, sorry.  This is the only function that performs context
 * switching.  The multistack version doesn't jump to the task body if its TID
 * has been maked as stacked.  This is used to switch to a task that has been
 * suspend by a previous call to EE_std_change_contex(). */

      Please notice that the "goto begin" is actually a recursive call to
      EE_std_change_context_multi(), but in this way there is no stack growing.
      
      Please notice also that 'tid' must NOT be saved onto the stack before
      switching stacks, otherwise when switching from another stack back to the
      current one, you would overwrite its value.

      For processors where the return address is saved in a register, that
      register must be saved in the stack too.

      switch_stacks() should also update EE_hal_active_tos.

    This works only with two's complements architecture. Casting beetween
    signed/unsigned integer in C is defined by value not by representation and
    only two's complements grant the the equivalence between the two.

    Standard Section 4.7/2 [conv.integral]:

    If the destination type is unsigned, the resulting value is the least
    unsigned integer congruent to the source integer (modulo 2^n where n is
    the number of bits used to represent the unsigned type).

    Note: In a twoâ€™s complement representation, this conversion is conceptual
    and there is no change in the bit pattern (if there is no truncation).
