<title>LaunchPad Temperature Sensor Demo</title>
   
<small_descr>
A monostack demo project to periodically read the internal temperature sensor
and display temperature deltas on the LEDs.
</small_descr>

<long_descr>
This demo shows the basic structure of an ERIKA Enterprise monostack project, and includes examples of TASKs and ISRs.

The application uses timerA to periodically raise an interrupt which activates Task1.
Task1 starts an ADC conversion to read the internal temperature sensor.
When the ADC conversion finishes an interrupt is raised which activates Task2.
Task2 reads the results of the ADC conversion and controls the LEDs depending on whether the current temperature is above, below or the same as the reference temperature.
The reference temperature is read at start-up and whenever button 1 is pressed.

This demo could be made more compact by removing Task1 and starting the ADC conversion from
within the timerA ISR. That exercise is left to the reader.
