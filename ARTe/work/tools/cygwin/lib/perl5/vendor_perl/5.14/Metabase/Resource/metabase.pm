=head1 NAME

Metabase::Resource::metabase - class for Metabase resources

=head1 VERSION

version 0.021

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $resource = Metabase::Resource->new(
    "metabase:user:B66C7662-1D34-11DE-A668-0DF08D1878C0"
  );

  my $resource_meta = $resource->metadata;
  my $typemap       = $resource->metadata_types;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generates resource metadata for resources of the scheme 'metabase'.

The L<Metabase::Resource::metabase> class supports the following sub-type(s).

=head2 fact 

  my $resource = Metabase::Resource->new(
    "metabase:fact:bd83d51e-0eea-11df-8413-0018f34ec37c"
  );

This resource is for a generic Metabase Fact.  (I.e. for a Fact about another
Fact).  For the example above, the resource metadata structure would contain
the following elements:

  scheme       => metabase
  type         => user
  fact         => bd83d51e-0eea-11df-8413-0018f34ec37c

=head2 user

  my $resource = Metabase::Resource->new(
    "metabase:user:b66c7662-1d34-11de-a668-0df08d1878c0"
  );

This resource is for a Metabase user. (I.e. corresponding to the GUID of a
Metabase::User::Profile.) For the example above, the resource metadata
structure would contain the following elements:

  scheme       => metabase
  subtype      => user
  user         => b66c7662-1d34-11de-a668-0df08d1878c0
