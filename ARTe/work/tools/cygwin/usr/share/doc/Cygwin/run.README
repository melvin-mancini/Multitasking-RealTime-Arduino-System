Port Notes:
----------  run-1.3.0-1 - 2013-Jul-24 -----------
* Avoid failure on cygwin-1.7.21 vs. GetCommandLine not being populated.
  This was fixed in cygwin-1.7.22 but it's good to clean up this code
  anyway.
* Massive refactoring to share implementations (at the source code
  level) with run2.
* -wait need not be the first argument
* New options --run-nogui, --run-notty, --run-verbose,
  and --run-debug[=N] controlling how run.exe itself reports
  error conditions and other messages.
  + By default, it is silent. If any messages are enabled
    via --run-verbose or --run-debug=N, then they will either
    be reported on stderr, or in windows popup boxes.
  + stderr is used if run.exe is launched from the cmdline, or
    if --run-nogui.
  + Windows popup boxes are used if run.exe is launched by
    doubleclicking it or by a Windows shortcut, or if --run-notty.

----------  run-1.2.0-1 - 2013-May-30 -----------
* For cygwin platforms, require > 1,7.0
* Rely on cygport auto-generated setup.hint file
* First build for 64bit cygwin
* Adds debug package
* Adds support for mingw64 (32bit,64bit) as well as mingw.org compilers.

----------  run-1.1.13-1 - 2011-Jan-25 -----------
* Fix segfault related to symlinks (Jonathan Kamens)
* Remove ancient workarounds for cygwin B19 and B20: don't use
  CYGWIN_CONV_* macros but instead call cygwin_conv_* functions
  directly.
* For cygwin-1.7, avoid deprecated cygwin_conv_* functions.
  NOTE: Only the barest minimal changes were made, so (a) non-ascii
  characters still not supported, and (b) long pathnames are not
  yet supported. This will occur on the new 1.2 development stream.

----------  run-1.1.12-11 - 2009-Dec-01 -----------
* Ensure stdout and stderr for inferior are distinct (fixes bug
  that occurs with some versions of cygwin).

----------  run-1.1.12-10 - 2009-08-18 -----------
* Fix various 100% CPU usage issues
* Logical refactoring: run only creates (and hides) a console
  if absolutely necessary. Otherwise, it relies on an existing (hidden)
  console, or avoids the issue entirely if $target itself is GUI.

----------  run-1.1.11-10 - 2009-08-10 -----------
* Fork for cygwin-1.7 packaging. Underlying source branch will occur
  later, with 1.2.x.

----------  run-1.1.11-1 - 2009-08-10 -----------
* New maintainer (Charles Wilson took over from Alexander Gottwald)
* Updated build machinery
* Switch to cygport build framework.
* Added patch to support invisible consoles on Windows 7 (Corinna Vinschen)
* Modified invisiconsole mechanism on cygwin-1.5/WinXP+ (Corinna Vinschen)
* Remove explicit requires: cygwin; rely on sourceware infrastructure
  to add it back.

----------  run-1.1.10-1 - 2006-05-22 -----------
* Create a real hidden console 

----------  run-1.1.9-1 -- 2006-04-06 -----------
* Remove quotes from search path. Fixes problem with spaces in filenames

----------  run-1.1.8-1 -- 2006-03-31 -----------
* Remove quotes from exename. Fixes problem with spaces in filenames

----------  run-1.1.7-1 -- 2006-03-08 -----------
* Copy cygwin environment variables to windows environment
* Disable WinMainCRTStartup wrapper

----------  run-1.1.6-1 -- 2005-11-09 -----------
* The order of icons has been adjusted so the X is now at index 2
  again and X-start-menu-icons should display right.
* Manpage added

----------  run-1.1.5-1 -- 2005-10-26 -----------
* Extracted from X-startup-scripts package
