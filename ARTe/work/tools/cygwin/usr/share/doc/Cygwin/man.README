Build instructions:
  unpack man-<Pack-Ver>-<Cyg-Rel>-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
        unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport man.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/man-<Pack-Ver>-<Cyg-Rel>-src.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/man-<Pack-Ver>-<Cyg-Rel>.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/man-debuginfo-<Pack-Ver>-<Cyg-Rel>.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/manlint-<Pack-Ver>-<Cyg-Rel>.tar.bz2

Or use 'cygport man.cygport prep' to get a patched source directory

To find out the files included in the binary distribution, you can
use "cygcheck -l man man-debuginfo manlint", or browse the listing for the 
appropriate version at <http://cygwin.com/packages/>.

Cygwin specific changes:
========================

 o added m and 8c to the default man sections list, cygwin has man pages
   in directories /usr/share/man/man8c and /usr/X11R6/man/manm
 o fixed italian man page
 o added /usr/X11R6/man:/usr/local/share/man:/usr/local/man to the default
   manpath in makewhatis
 o postinstall script adds symlinks from man to manpath for binary and
   manpage

Additionally the following things have been changed since the interim
version man-1.5m2-1:

 o The following two lines in man.conf

   NROFF                /usr/bin/nroff -c -mandoc
   PAGER                /usr/bin/less -isrR

   seem to fix the output of ESC sequences


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Certain versions of the FHS recommend putting formatted versions of

 /usr/.../share/man/[locale/]manx/page.x

into

 /var/cache/man/.../[locale/]catx/page.x.

The keyword FHS in man.conf will cause this behaviour and is now the default.
Explicitly given catdirs override. See comments in the man.conf file.
