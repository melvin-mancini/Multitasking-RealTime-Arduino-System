terminfo0
========================================================================
A fork of the terminfo database normally distributed with the ncurses
package. This version is configured for use with cygncurses-8.dll from
5.5-10 and older, and its clients (although the terminfo.src terminal
definitions may be taken from newer versions of ncurses). The difference
between this package and the "regular" terminfo package for cygwin is
the structure of the terminfo database.

In this version, the entries are arranged by the first letter of the
entry name. Because this can cause problems on case-insensitve file
systems, the newer terminfo package arranges entries by the 2-char hex
code of the first letter of the entry name.  That is:
   old:   r/rxvt    R/Rxvt    (clash!)
   new:   72/rxvt   52/Rxvt   (no clash)
Both versions of the database can be installed at the same time. The
newer structure is used by cygncurses-9.dll its clients.

========================================================================

Build instructions:
  unpack terminfo0-5.5_YYYYMMDD-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
	 unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./terminfo0-5.5_YYYYMMDD-X.cygport all

  NOTE: you MUST have the 'tic0.exe' program installed.
        Otherwise, the wrong database layout will be used.

This will create:
  /usr/src/terminfo0-5.5_YYYYMMDD-X.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/terminfo0-extra-5.5_YYYYMMDD-X.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/terminfo0-5.5_YYYYMMDD-X-src.tar.bz2

Or use 'cygport ./terminfo0-5.5_YYYYMMDD-X.cygport prep' to get a 
patched source directory

To find out the files included in the binary distribution, you can
use "cygcheck -l terminfo0", or browse the listing for the appropriate
version at <http://cygwin.com/packages/>.

Port Notes:
----------  terminfo0-5.5_20061104-12 -- 2010 Mar 24 -----------
* Add cygwin-old for 1.5 compatibility (reverts to kbs=^H)
* Support vt100 sequences -- Thomas Wolff
* Make cygwinDBG's tbc entry match that provided in the regular
  terminfo package.

----------  terminfo0-5.5_20061104-11 -- 2009 Nov 26 -----------
* Includes patches to change the backspace key from ^H to \177
  (that is, ^?) on screen, cygwin, and xterm.  As the default behavior
  of screen itself is to use ^? for backspace, this agrees with current
  behavior. Recently cygwin-1.7's console handling code was changed to
  also use ^? for backspace (but not cygwin-1.5's) -- so this version
  of terminfo, unlike the -1 release for cygwin-1.5, also changes the
  terminal database info for the cygwin console to match.  Finally,
  it is expected that soon, the cygwin-1.7 version of xterm will also
  change to use ^? -- but it does not yet do so (and we do not expect
  the cygwin-1.5 version of xterm to ever change in this way).  So,
  for now, on cygwin-1.7, you may need to add the following lines
        *backarrowKeyIsErase: true
        *ptyInitialErase: true
  to your /etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm file after installing this
  edition of terminfo.

----------  terminfo0-5.5_20061104-10 -- 2009 Feb 28 -----------
* Fork for cygwin-1.7 development
* Build with cygport-0.9.4

----------  terminfo0-5.5_20061104-2 -- 2009 Feb 28 -----------
* Fork from terminfo package; this one is structured for use
  with older cygncurses-8.dll DLLs.
* Split into two packages:
  - terminfo0 contains what Fedora 'ncurses-base' does;
    basically, cygwin, vt*, xterm*, putty*, screen*, and rxvt*
    with a few others.
  - terminfo0-extra contains everything else
