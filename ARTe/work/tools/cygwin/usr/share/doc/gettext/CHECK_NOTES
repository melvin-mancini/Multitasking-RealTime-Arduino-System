Perhaps because our tcl is not pure cygwin, but rather win32ish,
and is not built with i18n support?


NOTE: there were four other failures that arose because of the
      changes to localename.  These were:
         format-c-3
         format-c-4
         plural-1
         plural-2
      but the test suite was patched to avoid these failures.
      The problem is rather complicated; gettext-0.18.1.1 now has a
      libintl_setlocale function that is used by libintl clients,
      instead of the system setlocale.  The localename patch left
      that in place, but ensured that it did far less work -- was less
      obtrusive -- in its interposition between clients and the system
      setlocale.  However, some of that eliminated 'work' also allowed
      the gettext test suite to 'cheat' a bit -- it used non-existent
      locales (like 'fr' rather than 'fr_FR'), and *re-hijacked* the
      setlocale function itself.  None of that works anymore -- and
      *actual* clients are unlikely to need/want to do it -- so the
      test suite was patched to use real locales in all cases, and to
      not re-hijack.

gettext-tools/gnulib-tests
===================================================================
[old note; unverified in the current release]: All tests fail when
--enable-relocation (the tests do not "activate" the relocation
support, but the gnulib library they link to expect it).

When not --enable-relocation (the normal case):
2 of 120 tests failed (3 tests were not run)
but 2 of the passes actually should be failures.

FAIL: test-file-has-acl.sh -- file_has_acl("tmpdir0") returned yes,
      expected no.  This is expected on cygwin; all files always have
      ACLs (there are default ones that can't be removed using cygwin
      setfacl).

PASS: test-copy-acl.sh     -- but
      coredump at line 205; also 'setfacl -d group:0 tmpfile0
                                  setfacl: illegal acl entries'
PASS: test-copy-file.sh    -- but
      coredump at line 199; also 'setfacl -d group:0 tmpfile0
                                  setfacl: illegal acl entries'

      In both of these cases, I suspect the segfault is due to poor error
      handling when setfacl reports an error.  FWIW, the line numbers
      reported seem to be off:
         test-copy-acl.sh:205   'case $acl_flavor in'
         test-copy-file.sh:199  'case $acl_flavor in'
      I can't see those being the cause of a segfault (in bash?)
