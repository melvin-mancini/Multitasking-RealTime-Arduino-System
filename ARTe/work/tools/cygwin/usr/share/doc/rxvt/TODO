- Convert checks for char/short/int/long to Xmd.h defines?

- Improve documentation...

- Multichar font (eg. Kanji) bold-overstrike pixel dropping support

- Need font-check for multichar fonts (eg. Kanji).

- Extend menu language / facility

- add commandline option to change FONT0_IDX - i.e. start with a different
  font from the main font list, e.g. "rxvt -<...> -1" to start as if we had
  already pressed Shift-KP_Subtract (for some yet unchosen <...> option)

- reset colours on RESET sequence (ESC c)

In progress:
- Rewrite event-queue handling (and fix reintroduced font size change bug)
- Add Unicode support (work is being done by Xianping Ge <xge@ics.uci.edu>
  and others)
- extend keysym support to allow for modifiers for keysyms (work from
  David Oriva <oriva@agames.com> not yet added)
- port graphics/ directory to more platforms (including mine :-) )
