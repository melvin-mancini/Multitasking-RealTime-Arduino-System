mingw-org-wsl (Windows System Libraries):
=====
This package contains both the C Runtime (libcrt) and the Windows API (winapi)
definitions as provided by the MinGW.org team.  These libraries can be used
for both 32 bit and 64 bit Windows programming.  We have extended some parts
of the C runtime to be C99 compliant but for the most part you can find the
documentation provided by http://msdn.microsoft.com to be your best source for
how to use these libraries in your C programming.  The GNU C++ compiler (g++)
has its own implementation of the C++ standard and the documentation you find
for stdc++ on the http://gcc.gnu.org site will be your best source of informa-
tion for it.  Note that some of the C++ API will not able to be used on Windows
due to lack of implementation for the Windows platform.

Changes between versions are being given in the following file:
c:\mingw\share\doc\mingwrt\NEWS or c:\mingw\share\doc\w32api\NEWS.
Note that these two files are exactly the same since the source has now been
combined.  Changes for versions earlier than 4.0 you will need to look at the
source files for the historical ChangeLog.
