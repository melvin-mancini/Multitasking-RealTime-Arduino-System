This package is merely a fork of ncurses' terminfo.src
file, with enough autotools stuff around it so that it
can be build separately.  The autotools stuff was also 
taken from ncurses, not written from scratch for this 
package -- so don't try to autoreconf it!

Recommend:
./configure \
  --prefix=/usr \
  --enable-symlinks \
  --enable-tcap-names \
  --with-default-terminfo-dir=/usr/share/terminfo \
  --with-install-prefix=/tmp
make install.data 


The file
    terminfo.src
is exactly the same as the one in the ncurses tree, after
all relevant Official Ncurses Patches and Rollups have been
applied (up to the date of this package).
