This package is merely a fork of ncurses' terminfo.src
file, with enough autotools stuff around it so that it
can be build separately.  [*]

Recommended configure options:
./configure \
  --prefix=/usr \
  --enable-symlinks \
  --enable-tcap-names \
  --with-default-terminfo-dir=/usr/share/terminfo \
  --with-install-prefix=/tmp
make install.data 


The file
    terminfo.src
is exactly the same as the one in the ncurses tree, after
all relevant Official Ncurses Patches and Rollups have been
applied (up to the date of this package).



[*] The autoconf files (aclocal.m4, configure.in, etc)
were also taken directly from ncurses (with only slight
modifications), and not written from scratch for this package.
Therefore, you shouldn't try to autoreconf it -- unless you
use the patched version of autoconf-2.13 that is required
by the ncurses package (see
http://invisible-island.net/autoconf/autoconf.html).

Also, this means that `configure --help' will report a lot
of options that have nothing to do with terminfo, but are
only applicable to ncurses itself. Furthermore, because it
does so much additional checking, the configure script takes
a lot longer to run than is strictly required by terminfo alone.
