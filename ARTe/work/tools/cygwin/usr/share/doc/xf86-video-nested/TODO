TODO

- check if minimum/maximum virtual sizes are set correctly
- I guess most/all code that deals with mode is somehow wrong
- define a real policy for the modes we allow the user to use
- require 1.8 ABI because of HW_SKIP_CONSOLE?
- add some checking for when the bottom-layer X dies?
- standardize function definitions (coding style)
- implement FreeScreen? (http://www.x.org/archive/X11R6.8.2/doc/DESIGN6.html#38)
- implement the code that validates depths, implement other checks
- compare Xlib's bpp with pScrn's bpp? is it needed? other similar checks?
- add some Option "fullscreen"? (for Multiseat)
- write the xcb backend
- write other backends (for different window systems, or maybe using portable
  libraries like SDL or Qt)
- ability to detach from one xserver and attach to other?
- be fully xrandr-aware
- xv?
- other extensions?
- improve the code that redraws the screen (damage tracking)
- fully understand the fb/shadow code to get a clue on what's really going on =)
