=head1 NAME

ptee - emulate the GNU tee program with Perl

=head1 VERSION

version 0.14

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 ptee [OPTIONS]... [FILENAMES]...

 OPTIONS:
 
    --append or -a
        append to file(s) rather than overwrite

    --help or -h
        give usage information

    --version or -V
        print the version number of this program

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<ptee> is a pure Perl emulation of the standard GNU tool C<tee> and is
designed to be a platform independent replacement for operating systems without
a native C<tee> program.

It passes input received on STDIN through to STDOUT while also writing a copy
of the input to any files provided as arguments.  By default, files will be
overwritten, but this behavior may be altered with the C<--append> option.  

Unlike C<tee>, C<ptee> does not support ignoring interrupts, as signal handling
is not sufficiently portable.
